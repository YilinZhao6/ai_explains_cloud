
Hey, I am creating a website (or it can be hosted locally in my computer) that generates a self-learning guide for a topic that user wants to study. it will take inputs from user, and then the website will generate a .md file (an example that is attached below) Displayed for user to read. and user will select some parts that he don't know to ask further questions...

Here is the function that I want to succeed:
--A very good chat interface. *like that of cohere coral. user enters the query, and the code in background will generate solutsions
--The backaround code is written in python. The schema should be compatible with python
--The user should be able to log in.
--I am building this website for demonstration purposes for applying to Ycombinator.
--It should be easy to deploy on some cloud services, e.g. on google.
--I basically have the python code ready! all i need is a frontend. 

So I would like to hear your advice. I hope this one will be not too complex!

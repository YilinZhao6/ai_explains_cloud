Article Content:
{article_text}

Article Outline Sections:
{json.dumps(section_titles, indent=2)}

Available Images:
{json.dumps(all_images, indent=2)}

Selection Guidelines:
1. Select maximum 2-3 images per section to maintain readability
2. Images MUST be assigned to sections using EXACT section titles from the outline
3. For each image, provide a detailed explanation of how it relates to specific content within that section
4. Prioritize images that:
   - Best illustrate key concepts
   - Have high clarity and educational value
   - Have clear, informative descriptions
5. Ensure even distribution across sections
6. Avoid redundant or very similar images
7. Consider image resolution and quality

For each selected image, you must include:
- The exact section title from the outline
- A specific explanation of how the image relates to the section's content
- A relevance score (0-1) based on how well it illustrates the concept

Return a list of selected images with their complete metadata and assignments."""

ARTICLE TOPIC: {outline_data.get('topic', '')}

FULL ARTICLE TEXT:
{article_text}

Generate a single command for image_retrieval_command_args.py to search for images on Wikipedia Commons.

Tasks:
1. Analyze both the outline's image requests AND the full article text
2. Identify any additional concepts in the article text that would benefit from visual representation
3. Combine similar image requests and remove redundant ones
4. Prioritize images that will enhance learning comprehension

Guidelines:
1. Default is 3 images per keyword unless context suggests otherwise
2. Keywords should be truly relevant to the educational content
3. Consider sections without explicit image requests that might benefit from visuals
4. Format: python image_retrieval_command_args.py "keyword1:limit" "keyword2:limit"

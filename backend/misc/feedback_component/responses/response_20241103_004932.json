  "concept": "Nuclei",
  "explanation": "In the context of nuclear physics, 'nuclei' refer to the central cores of atoms, composed of protons and neutrons, which are known collectively as nucleons. They are essential in understanding nuclear reactions like photodisintegration, where high-energy gamma-ray photons interact with the nuclei of atoms to cause them to eject subatomic particles (like protons or neutrons). This process transforms the original nucleus into a different element or isotope, playing a crucial role in various astrophysical phenomena, such as stellar nucleosynthesis."

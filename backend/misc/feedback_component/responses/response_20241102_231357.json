  "concept": "Nuclei",
  "explanation": "In nuclear physics, a nucleus refers to the dense central core of an atom, composed of protons and neutrons (together called nucleons). Each element is characterized by its atomic number, which is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus. The behavior and interactions of nuclei are fundamental to understanding various nuclear processes, including reactions like photodisintegration, where a nucleus can absorb high-energy gamma-rays and undergo changes by ejecting particles, leading to transformations into different elements or isotopes."

  "concept": "Nuclei",
  "explanation": "In nuclear physics, a nucleus refers to the central core of an atom, consisting of protons and neutrons. It is held together by the strong nuclear force and is responsible for much of the atom's mass. In the context of photodisintegration, the nucleus absorbs high-energy gamma-ray photons, leading to the ejection of subatomic particles and transforming into a different nuclear species. Understanding nuclei is crucial for grasping nuclear reactions and the processes by which elements are formed in stars."

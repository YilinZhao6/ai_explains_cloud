## Definition and Basic Concepts
<p>A nuclear reaction is a fundamental process in nuclear physics where two nuclei, or a nucleus and a subatomic particle, collide to produce one or more new nuclides.</p>

<p>This transformation must result in at least one new nuclide being formed, distinguishing it from nuclear scattering.</p>

## Key Components of a Nuclear Reaction:
1. **Reactants**:
   - Two nuclei, or
   - One nucleus and one subatomic particle

2. **Products**:
   - New nuclide(s)
   - Potentially released particles or energy

#

## Nuclear Reaction vs. Nuclear Scattering
It's important to differentiate between these two nuclear processes:

**Nuclear Reaction**:
- Results in transformation of at least one nuclide
- Changes the nature of participating nuclei
- Produces new nuclear species

**Nuclear Scattering**:
- No transformation of nuclides occurs
- Particles separate without changing their fundamental nature
- Only involves energy and momentum transfer

#

## Probability Considerations
While theoretically nuclear reactions could involve multiple particles, most observed reactions are binary (involving two initial particles) because:
- The probability of three or more nuclei meeting simultaneously at the same point is extremely low
- Binary collisions dominate the reaction landscape
- Notable exception: the triple alpha process in stellar nucleosynthesis

#

## Types of Nuclear Reactions
<p>Nuclear reactions can be categorized into two main types: fusion and fission.</p>
<figure style="float: right; clear: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; max-width: 40%; background-color: #f8f9fa; border: 1px solid #a2a9b1; padding: 8px; box-sizing: border-box;">

<p>Each type has distinct characteristics and occurs under specific conditions.</p>

## Important Note
The total relativistic energy must be conserved in all nuclear reactions. The apparent "missing mass" always appears as one or more of these energy forms, primarily due to nuclear binding energy differences between reactants and products.

## Energy Conservation in Nuclear Reactions
<p>In nuclear reactions, energy is conserved according to Einstein's principle of mass-energy equivalence (E = mc²).</p>

<p>This conservation manifests through the relationship between mass defect and released energy.</p>

## Q-Value and Energy Balance
The Q-value represents the energy released or absorbed during a nuclear reaction:
- **Positive Q-value**: Exothermic reaction (releases energy)
- **Negative Q-value**: Endothermic reaction (absorbs energy)

The Q-value can be calculated using two equivalent methods:
1. **Mass Difference Method**:
   ```
   Q = (Initial total mass - Final total mass) × c²
   ```
   where masses are in atomic mass units (u) and c² = 931 MeV/u

2. **Kinetic Energy Method**:
   ```
   Q = (Final kinetic energy sum) - (Initial kinetic energy sum)
   ```

#

## Example Calculation
Consider the reaction: ⁶Li + ²H → 2⁴He

1. Calculate mass difference:
   - Initial mass = 6.015u + 2.014u = 8.029u
   - Final mass = 2(4.0026u) = 8.0052u
   - Mass defect = 8.029u - 8.0052u = 0.0238u

2. Convert to energy:
   - E = (0.0238u)(931 MeV/u) = 22.2 MeV

#

## Energy Distribution
The conserved energy in nuclear reactions can appear in three main forms:

1. **Kinetic Energy**:
   - Motion energy of product particles
   - Can be converted to electrostatic energy for charged particles

2. **Electromagnetic Radiation**:
   - High-energy gamma rays
   - X-rays from electron shell rearrangement

3. **Nuclear Excitation**:
   - Metastable energy levels in product nuclei
   - Eventually released through nuclear decay

#

## Fusion Reactions
Nuclear fusion occurs when two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, typically releasing additional particles and energy in the process.

Key characteristics of fusion reactions:
1. **Reactants**: Light nuclei (typically isotopes of hydrogen or helium)
2. **Products**: 
   - Heavier nucleus
   - Additional particles (usually protons or neutrons)
   - Significant energy release

Example of a fusion reaction:
```
²H + ³H → ⁴He + n + 17.6 MeV
```

Requirements for fusion:
- Extremely high temperatures (millions of degrees)
- Sufficient density of reactants
- Adequate confinement time

Natural occurrence: Fusion powers stars through various processes like the proton-proton chain and CNO cycle.

#

## Fission Reactions
Nuclear fission involves the splitting of a heavy nucleus into lighter nuclei after absorbing additional particles, typically neutrons.

Key characteristics of fission reactions:
1. **Reactants**: 
   - Heavy nucleus (usually uranium or plutonium)
   - Incident neutron
2. **Products**:
   - Two or three lighter nuclei
   - Additional neutrons
   - Energy release

Example of a fission reaction:
```
²³⁵U + n → ⁹²Kr + ¹⁴¹Ba + 3n + 200 MeV
```

Requirements for fission:
- Fissionable material
- Neutron source
- Proper neutron energy (often thermal neutrons)

Important considerations:
- Can lead to chain reactions when additional neutrons cause subsequent fissions
- Forms the basis for nuclear power generation
- Requires careful control and moderation in practical applications

## Comparison of Fusion vs. Fission
| Aspect | Fusion | Fission |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Initial nuclei | Light | Heavy |
| Temperature requirements | Very high | Moderate |
| Natural occurrence | Stars | Rare (some isotopes) |
| Energy yield per reaction | Lower per reaction but higher per mass | High per reaction |
| Radiation products | Generally fewer | Significant radioactive products |

## Introduction to Schrödinger Equation

### Definition of the Schrödinger Equation

The Schrödinger equation is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, providing a mathematical framework to describe how the quantum state of a physical system evolves over time. It is analogous to Newton's laws in classical mechanics, but for quantum systems. The equation is a partial differential equation that governs the wave function of a non-relativistic quantum-mechanical system.

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is expressed as:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(r,t) = \hat{H}\Psi(r,t)$$

where:
- $\Psi(r,t)$ is the wave function of the system, representing the quantum state.
- $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, which corresponds to the total energy of the system.
- $i$ is the imaginary unit.
- $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.

The wave function $\Psi(r,t)$ contains all the information about the system's state, and its square modulus $|\Psi(r,t)|^2$ gives the probability density of finding a particle at a position $r$ at time $t$.

**Example: Particle in a One-Dimensional Box**

**Problem**: Consider a particle confined in a one-dimensional box of length $L$ with infinitely high walls. What is the wave function of the particle?

**Solution**: The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = E\psi
$$

Solving this equation with boundary conditions $\psi(0) = \psi(L) = 0$, we find:

$$
\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right), \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
$$

The corresponding energy levels are:

$$
E_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}
$$

### Historical Development

The Schrödinger equation was formulated by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1926. It marked a pivotal development in quantum mechanics, akin to the role of Newton's laws in classical mechanics. Schrödinger's work was influenced by the wave-particle duality concept proposed by Louis de Broglie, which suggested that particles could exhibit wave-like properties.

Schrödinger's equation successfully explained the quantized energy levels of the hydrogen atom, which had been observed experimentally but not theoretically justified until then. This breakthrough provided a robust theoretical foundation for quantum mechanics, leading to further advancements in atomic, nuclear, and solid-state physics.

The equation's formulation was a significant milestone, earning Schrödinger the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933. It remains a fundamental tool in understanding and predicting the behavior of quantum systems.

## Mathematical Formulation and Interpretation

### Mathematical Formulation of the Schrödinger Equation

The Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. It is analogous to Newton's laws in classical mechanics but applies to quantum systems. The equation is expressed as a wave equation for the wave function of a system, incorporating both potential and kinetic energy terms.

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is given by:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(r,t) = \hat{H}\Psi(r,t)$$

where:
- $\Psi(r,t)$ is the wave function of the system, representing the quantum state.
- $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, which corresponds to the total energy of the system.
- $i$ is the imaginary unit.
- $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.

The Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H}$ typically includes terms for both kinetic and potential energy, allowing the equation to predict the evolution of the wave function over time. This equation plays a role similar to that of Newton's laws and conservation of energy in classical mechanics, providing a framework for predicting the future behavior of quantum systems.

### Implications of Wave Functions in Quantum Mechanics

Wave functions are central to quantum mechanics, providing a probabilistic description of the position and momentum of quantum particles. The wave function $\Psi(r,t)$ contains all the information about a system's state, and its square modulus $|\Psi(r,t)|^2$ gives the probability density of finding a particle at a position $r$ at time $t$.

In quantum mechanics, wave functions are complex probability amplitudes, and their interpretation is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This means that while the Schrödinger equation can predict the evolution of a wave function, it does not provide a definite outcome for a single measurement. Instead, it offers a probability distribution for possible outcomes.

The concept of wave functions introduces the idea of superposition, where a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until a measurement is made. This leads to phenomena such as interference and entanglement, which are unique to quantum mechanics and have no classical analogs.

Understanding wave functions and their implications is crucial for grasping the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and the behavior of particles at the quantum level.

## Applications of the Schrödinger Equation

### Application to the Hydrogen Atom

The Schrödinger equation's application to the hydrogen atom is a landmark achievement in quantum mechanics. By solving the equation for the hydrogen atom, Schrödinger was able to predict the atom's energy levels with remarkable accuracy, providing experimental validation for quantum mechanics.

The hydrogen atom consists of a single electron orbiting a proton. The potential energy of the electron in the electric field of the proton is given by the Coulomb potential:

$$
V(r) = -\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r}
$$

where $e$ is the electron charge, $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, and $r$ is the distance from the proton.

The time-independent Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom is:

$$
\left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(r) \right) \psi(r) = E \psi(r)
$$

Solving this equation yields the quantized energy levels of the hydrogen atom:

$$
E_n = -\frac{m e^4}{8 \varepsilon_0^2 h^2 n^2}
$$

where $n$ is the principal quantum number.

**Example: Energy Levels of Hydrogen Atom**

**Problem**: Calculate the energy of the first excited state ($n=2$) of the hydrogen atom.

**Solution**: Using the formula for energy levels:

$$
E_n = -\frac{m e^4}{8 \varepsilon_0^2 h^2 n^2}
$$

For $n=2$, the energy is:

$$
E_2 = -\frac{m e^4}{8 \varepsilon_0^2 h^2 \times 4}
$$

This calculation shows that the energy of the first excited state is one-fourth of the ground state energy, illustrating the quantized nature of atomic energy levels.

## Introduction to Schrödinger Equation

### Historical Context and Significance

The **Schrödinger equation** is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, formulated by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1926. It holds a pivotal role in quantum mechanics, akin to the importance of Newton's laws in classical mechanics. This equation provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of subatomic particles, which classical physics cannot adequately describe.

The equation emerged during a period when physicists were grappling with the dual nature of light and matter, as both particles and waves. Schrödinger's work was instrumental in developing wave mechanics, a branch of quantum mechanics that describes particles as wave functions. This approach revolutionized our understanding of atomic and subatomic processes, laying the groundwork for modern physics.

### Definition and Mathematical Formulation

The Schrödinger equation is essentially a wave equation that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. It is expressed in two forms: the time-dependent and time-independent equations.

#### Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)
\end{aligned}
$$

- **$\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$**: The wave function, representing the quantum state of the system.
- **$i$**: The imaginary unit.
- **$\hbar$**: Reduced Planck's constant.
- **$\hat{H}$**: The Hamiltonian operator, representing the total energy of the system.

This equation describes how the wave function evolves over time, providing insights into the probability distribution of a particle's position and momentum.

#### Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation

For systems where the potential energy does not change with time, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is used:

$$
\hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r}) = E\Psi(\mathbf{r})
$$

- **$E$**: The energy eigenvalue associated with the wave function.

This form is particularly useful for solving problems involving stationary states, such as the energy levels of electrons in an atom.

**Example: Solving the Schrödinger Equation for a Particle in a Box**

**Problem**: Consider a particle confined in a one-dimensional box with infinitely high walls. Determine the allowed energy levels of the particle.

**Solution**: The potential energy inside the box is zero, and infinite outside. The time-independent Schrödinger equation simplifies to:

$$
\frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\Psi(x)}{dx^2} = E\Psi(x)
$$

Solving this differential equation with boundary conditions $\Psi(0) = \Psi(L) = 0$, where $L$ is the length of the box, yields:

$$
\Psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)
$$

The corresponding energy levels are:

$$
E_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}
$$

where $n$ is a positive integer.

## Mathematical Formulation of Schrödinger Equation

### Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation

The **time-dependent Schrödinger equation** is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the quantum state of a physical system evolves over time. It is expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)
\end{aligned}
$$

- **$\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$**: The wave function, representing the quantum state of the system at position $\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$.
- **$i$**: The imaginary unit, satisfying $i^2 = -1$.
- **$\hbar$**: Reduced Planck's constant, a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics.
- **$\hat{H}$**: The Hamiltonian operator, representing the total energy of the system, including both kinetic and potential energies.

This equation is pivotal in predicting the probability distribution of a particle's position and momentum over time.

### Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation

For systems where the potential energy does not change with time, the **time-independent Schrödinger equation** is used. It is derived from the time-dependent equation by assuming a separable solution of the form $\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \psi(\mathbf{r})e^{-iEt/\hbar}$, leading to:

$$
\hat{H}\psi(\mathbf{r}) = E\psi(\mathbf{r})
$$

- **$E$**: The energy eigenvalue associated with the wave function $\psi(\mathbf{r})$.

This form is particularly useful for solving problems involving stationary states, such as the energy levels of electrons in an atom. The solutions to this equation provide the possible energy levels (eigenvalues) and corresponding wave functions (eigenstates) of the system.

### Key Points

- The Schrödinger equation is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, providing a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of quantum systems.
- The time-dependent form describes the evolution of quantum states over time, while the time-independent form is used for systems with time-invariant potentials.
- The wave function $\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$ encapsulates all the information about a quantum system, and its square modulus $|\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)|^2$ gives the probability density of finding a particle at position $\mathbf{r}$ at time $t$.

Understanding these equations is crucial for exploring more complex quantum systems and phenomena, such as quantum tunneling and entanglement.

## Applications of Schrödinger Equation in Quantum Mechanics

### Practicality and Examples

The **Schrödinger equation** is a fundamental tool in quantum mechanics, providing a mathematical framework to predict and describe the behavior of quantum systems. Its applications are vast, ranging from atomic models to complex quantum systems. Here, we will explore its practicality through specific examples.

#### Atomic Models

One of the most significant applications of the Schrödinger equation is in modeling atomic structures, particularly in predicting electron distributions and energy levels within an atom. The equation's ability to accurately describe these properties is crucial for understanding atomic behavior.

- **Hydrogen Atom**: Schrödinger's equation was first applied to the hydrogen atom, where it successfully predicted the atom's energy levels and electron orbitals. This application demonstrated the equation's power in describing atomic systems with remarkable precision.

  $$
  \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r}) = E\Psi(\mathbf{r})
  $$

  Here, $\hat{H}$ represents the Hamiltonian operator, $\Psi(\mathbf{r})$ is the wave function, and $E$ is the energy eigenvalue.

**Example: Energy Levels of the Hydrogen Atom**

**Problem**: Determine the energy levels of an electron in a hydrogen atom using the Schrödinger equation.

**Solution**: The potential energy $V(r)$ for an electron in a hydrogen atom is given by the Coulomb potential $V(r) = -\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r}$. Solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation:

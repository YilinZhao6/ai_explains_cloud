  "concept": "Nuclei Lighter than Iron",
  "explanation": "In the context of photodisintegration, the term \"nuclei lighter than iron\" refers to atomic nuclei that have an atomic mass number less than that of iron (which is 56, corresponding to isotope 56Fe). Common examples of nuclei lighter than iron include hydrogen (H), helium (He), lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and up to the vicinity of iron. \n\nPhotodisintegration of these lighter nuclei is characterized as endothermic, meaning it absorbs energy. As a result, when they absorb a high-energy gamma ray, they enter an excited state and subsequently decay by emitting subatomic particles, such as neutrons, protons, or alpha particles."

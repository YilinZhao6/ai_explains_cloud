  "concept": "Photon",
  "explanation": "A photon is a fundamental particle of light and electromagnetic radiation, characterized by having no mass and traveling at the speed of light. In the context of photodisintegration, a photon refers specifically to a high-energy gamma ray that is absorbed by an atomic nucleus, leading to changes within that nucleus. This absorption initiates the photodisintegration process, whereby the nucleus becomes excited and subsequently emits subatomic particles such as neutrons, protons, or alpha particles."

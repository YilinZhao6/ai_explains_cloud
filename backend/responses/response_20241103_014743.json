  "concept": "Alpha Particles in Photodisintegration",
  "explanation": "Alpha particles (symbolized as \u03b3,\u03b1) refer to a type of subatomic particle that can be emitted during the nuclear decay process known as photodisintegration. In this context, photodisintegration occurs when a target nucleus absorbs a high-energy gamma ray (\u03b3) and subsequently decays, releasing different types of particles. Specifically, when an alpha particle is emitted, it indicates that the nucleus has expelled a group of two protons and two neutrons, forming a helium nucleus (\u00b2He\u2074). This emission leads to a significant decrease in both the atomic mass (by 4) and the atomic number (by 2) of the target nucleus. Understanding the role of alpha particles is crucial as they constitute one of the main types of emissions observed in photodisintegration reactions, alongside neutrons and protons."

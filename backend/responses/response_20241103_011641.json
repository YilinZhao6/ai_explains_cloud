  "concept": "Heavy Nuclei",
  "explanation": "In nuclear physics, *heavy nuclei* refer to atomic nuclei that have a large number of protons and neutrons, typically those with atomic mass numbers greater than that of iron (atomic number 26). The term 'heavy' is relative; for example, elements like lead (Pb, atomic number 82) and uranium (U, atomic number 92) are considered heavy nuclei. These heavy nuclei possess strong nuclear forces that hold them together, and their greater mass leads to a variety of nuclear processes such as photodisintegration. In the context of the P-Process Mechanism, heavy nuclei are the target for reactions in supernovae that create proton-rich isotopes, leading to the formation of new, heavier elements essential for the chemical evolution of the universe."

  "explanation": "In the context of parallax, the term \"fundamental concept\" signifies that parallax is a key principle that underlies many important concepts in physics and astronomy. It is essential for understanding how we perceive the position of objects in space and is crucial in measuring distances, particularly to stars. Parallax highlights how perspective matters: because an object can appear differently when viewed from different angles, this shift can be quantitatively analyzed to determine distances in a practical and scientific manner. For example, as illustrated in the text, by observing a star from two distinct points in Earth's orbit, astronomers can calculate the star's distance using the parallax angle, a concept that is fundamental to both celestial navigation and the structure of the universe."

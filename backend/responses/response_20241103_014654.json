  "concept": "Universe",
  "explanation": "The universe refers to all of space-time, including all matter, energy, planets, stars, galaxies, and even the smallest particles. It encompasses everything that exists and follows the physical laws of nature such as gravity and electromagnetism. In the context of black hole formation and nucleosynthesis, the universe includes the cosmic structures that evolve over time due to various astrophysical processes. For example, when massive stars collapse into black holes, they can emit relativistic jets that distribute elements like metals across space. This contributes to the composition of the early universe, influencing the formation of new stars and galaxies."

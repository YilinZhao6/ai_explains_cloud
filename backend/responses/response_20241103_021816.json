  "concept": "High-Energy Photon (Gamma Ray)",
  "explanation": "A high-energy photon, often referred to as a gamma ray, is a form of electromagnetic radiation with very high energy. In the context of photodisintegration, this photon initiates the reaction when it is absorbed by an atomic nucleus. Upon absorption, the nucleus enters an excited state and subsequently decays, emitting subatomic particles such as neutrons, protons, or alpha particles, depending on the specific reaction occurring. The energy of these gamma rays is typically measured in electronvolts (eV), with a specific example in the document noting that a gamma ray must have an energy of at least 2.22 MeV to trigger the photodisintegration of deuterium."

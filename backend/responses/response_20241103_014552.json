  "concept": "Decrease in Atomic Mass and Number in Neutron Emission",
  "explanation": "In the context of neutron emission (\u03b3,n), the term \"decrease\" refers specifically to the change in the atomic mass of the nucleus after a neutron is ejected as a result of absorbing a gamma ray. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Gamma Ray Absorption**: The process begins when an atomic nucleus, such as beryllium-9 (\u2079Be), absorbs a high-energy gamma ray (\u03b3).\n\n2. **Neutron Ejection**: Following the absorption, the nucleus enters an excited state, and a neutron is emitted from it.\n\n3. **Atomic Mass**: The atomic mass is defined as the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Since the nucleus loses one neutron during neutron emission, its atomic mass decreases by 1. For example, \u2079Be consists of 4 protons and 5 neutrons, reducing to 8Be (\u2078Be), which has 4 protons and 4 neutrons.\n\n4. **Atomic Number**: The atomic number, which represents the number of protons in the nucleus, remains unchanged because a neutron is ejected, not a proton. Thus, the atomic number for beryllium, which is 4, stays the same.\n\nIn summary, during neutron emission (\u03b3,n), the loss of a neutron results in a decrease in atomic mass while retaining the same atomic number, leading to a new isotope of the original nucleus."

  "explanation": "The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics, describing how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. It is a type of mathematical relationship called a linear differential equation. In the context of quantum superposition, the equation provides a way to express the principle that a quantum system can simultaneously exist in multiple states. \n\nWhen we say that quantum superposition is mathematically represented by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, it means that if you have two or more possible states of a quantum system (denoted as solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation), these states can be combined linearly to form a new valid solution that also describes a possible state of the system. This is expressed as:\n\n$$ \n\\Psi = c_1\\Psi_1 + c_2\\Psi_2 \n$$\n\nwhere \\(\\Psi_1\\) and \\(\\Psi_2\\) are solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) are complex coefficients. These coefficients reflect the contributions of each state to the overall state of the system. Thus, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation not only governs quantum behavior but also encapsulates the essence of superposition in quantum systems."

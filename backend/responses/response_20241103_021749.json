  "concept": "Photon",
  "explanation": "A photon is a fundamental particle of light and electromagnetic radiation, characterized as a quantum of electromagnetic energy. In the context of photodisintegration, a photon serves as the triggering component that interacts with an atomic nucleus. When a gamma ray (which is a type of photon that possesses high energy) is absorbed by a target nucleus, it causes the nucleus to enter an excited state. This excitation leads to the nucleus immediately decaying by emitting subatomic particles, which is a part of the photodisintegration or photonuclear reaction process. Essentially, the photon facilitates the transformation of the nucleus while impacting its structure."

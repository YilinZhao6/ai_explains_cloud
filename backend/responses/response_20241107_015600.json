  "concept": "Quantification of Parallax Shift",
  "explanation": "The shift in an object's position, known as parallax, is caused by the change in the observer's viewpoint. When an observer views an object from two different positions, such as two distinct points in Earth's orbit around the Sun, the object appears to move against a more distant background. This apparent movement is quantified by measuring the angle (the parallax angle) that is formed between two lines of sight drawn from the observer's two positions to the object in question. Essentially, the shift occurs due to the relative change in distance between the observer and the observed object as their viewpoint changes."

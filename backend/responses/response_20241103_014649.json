  "concept": "Nucleus",
  "explanation": "In the context of nuclear physics, a nucleus refers to the central part of an atom. It is composed of protons and neutrons, collectively known as nucleons. The nucleus is responsible for the majority of an atom's mass and contains the positive charge due to the presence of protons. \n\nWhen discussing photodisintegration, the 'atomic nucleus' is crucial as it is the target that absorbs the high-energy gamma ray. This absorption excites the nucleus, leading to its subsequent decay and the emission of subatomic particles (like neutrons or protons). Thus, the nucleus plays a central role in nuclear processes, defining the characteristics and behaviors of atoms during reactions."

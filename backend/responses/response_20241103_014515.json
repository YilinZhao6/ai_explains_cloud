  "concept": "Isotopes",
  "explanation": "An isotope refers to variants of a particular chemical element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons in their atomic nuclei. This results in different atomic masses for isotopes of the same element, while their chemical properties remain largely similar. \n\nIn the context of the P-Process Mechanism during supernovae, isotopes play a significant role. Here, photodisintegration reactions target existing heavy nuclei and create proton-rich isotopes. This means that through the absorption of high-energy gamma rays, heavy atomic nuclei are transformed, leading to the formation of isotopes that have more protons relative to their neutrons. These isotopes contribute to the abundance and diversity of elements produced in the universe during stellar evolution."

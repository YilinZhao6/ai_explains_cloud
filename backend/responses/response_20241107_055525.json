  "concept": "Vantage Point",
  "explanation": "A vantage point refers to a specific location or perspective from which an observation or measurement is made. In the context of parallax, it is the different positions from which two observations of the same object are taken. For example, when measuring the parallax of a star, one vantage point could be Earth at one position in its orbit, and the second vantage point would be Earth six months later, when it has moved to the opposite side of its orbit. These two vantage points enable astronomers to observe the apparent shift in the star's position against the backdrop of more distant stars."

  "concept": "Schr\u00f6dinger Equation",
  "explanation": "The Schr\u00f6dinger Equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that serves as a mathematical model to predict how quantum systems evolve over time. It expresses the concept that the future state of a quantum system, described by its wave function, can be determined from its current state. Specifically, it shows how the wave function (which encapsulates the probability information of a particle's position and momentum) changes, allowing us to calculate the probabilities of finding a particle in various states at future times. Thus, it is crucial for understanding the dynamics of particles at the quantum level."

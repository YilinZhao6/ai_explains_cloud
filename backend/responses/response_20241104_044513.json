  "concept": "Technological Advancements in Measuring Parallax",
  "explanation": "The statement highlights that advancements in modern technology have led to more accurate measurements of parallax, a method used to determine distances to celestial objects. This improvement is particularly notable with the deployment of space-based observatories, like Hipparcos and Gaia. \n\n1. **Space-Based Observatories**: These are telescopes placed outside Earth's atmosphere, which reduces distortion caused by the atmosphere. \n\n2. **Precision Measurement**: Older methods of measuring parallax might have had limitations due to atmospheric disturbances and ground-based observational constraints. With space missions, the accuracy of parallax measurements has improved significantly (for example, Gaia measures angles with a precision of 20 microarcseconds).\n\n3. **Impact on Astronomy**: This increased precision allows astronomers to measure distances to a much larger number of stars and derive information about the structure of our galaxy and the universe beyond.\n\nIn summary, the advent of these technologies has allowed us to understand cosmic distances with much greater clarity and precision, forming a strong foundation for further astronomical research."

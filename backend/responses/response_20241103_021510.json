  "concept": "Reaction",
  "explanation": "In the context of photodisintegration, a **reaction** refers to the nuclear event that occurs when an atomic nucleus absorbs a high-energy gamma ray, leading to the emission of subatomic particles. Specifically, this process can result in the emission of neutrons, protons, or alpha particles, effectively changing the composition of the atomic nucleus. These nuclear transformations are classified based on the type of particle emitted, with three main types of reactions outlined: neutron emission (\u03b3,n), proton emission (\u03b3,p), and alpha particle emission (\u03b3,\u03b1). Each type of reaction has different implications for the atomic mass and number of the resulting nucleus, which plays a significant role in nuclear physics and astrophysical processes."

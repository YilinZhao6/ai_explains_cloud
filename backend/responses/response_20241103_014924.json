  "concept": "Endothermic Process",
  "explanation": "In the context of photodisintegration, an endothermic process refers to a reaction that absorbs energy from its surroundings. In this case, when nuclei lighter than iron undergo photodisintegration, they require an intake of energy to initiate the reaction. This energy is provided by the absorption of high-energy gamma rays, which excite the nucleus before it emits subatomic particles. Therefore, for lighter nuclei, energy is absorbed, making the overall process endothermic. In contrast, nuclei heavier than iron can release energy during photodisintegration, making that process exothermic."

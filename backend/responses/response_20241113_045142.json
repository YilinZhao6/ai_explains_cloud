  "concept": "Probability in Quantum Mechanics",
  "explanation": "In quantum mechanics, the probability of observing a particular state of a quantum system (like an electron) is determined by the coefficients used in its wave function representation. When a quantum system is in a superposition of different states, such as \\( \\Psi = c_1 \\psi_1 + c_2 \\psi_2 \\), the coefficients \\( c_1 \\) and \\( c_2 \\) are complex numbers that encode the likelihood of measuring the system in each respective state. The probabilities of observing the states \\( \\psi_1 \\) and \\( \\psi_2 \\) are given by the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients: \\( |c_1|^2 \\) for state \\( \\psi_1 \\) and \\( |c_2|^2 \\) for state \\( \\psi_2 \\). These probabilities must satisfy the normalization condition, ensuring that the total probability sums to 1: \\( |c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2 = 1 \\). Therefore, before measurement, the system exists in a blended state of possibilities, and we only obtain definitive outcomes upon measurement."

  "concept": "Collide to Produce in Nuclear Reactions",
  "explanation": "In the context of nuclear reactions, \"collide to produce\" refers to the interaction between atomic nuclei or between a nucleus and a subatomic particle (like a neutron or a proton). When these particles collide with sufficient energy, the result is a transformation that leads to the formation of new nuclides\u2014these are different types of atomic nuclei that can have varying numbers of protons and neutrons compared to the original particles. Essentially, the collision causes a nuclear change that creates one or more new nuclei, differing from merely scattering which does not result in new substances."

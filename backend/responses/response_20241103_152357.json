  "concept": "Parallax",
  "explanation": "Parallax refers to the apparent shift in an object's position when observed from different angles or viewpoints. This effect arises because the observer is viewing the object from multiple lines of sight. The fundamental principle behind measuring parallax involves the angle of displacement observed, typically referred to as the parallax angle (p). \n\n### Formula for Measuring Parallax:\nThe relationship between the parallax angle and the distance to the object can be expressed with the following formula:\n\n**Distance (d in parsecs) = 1 / Parallax (p in arcseconds)**\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Parallax Angle (p)**: This is measured in arcseconds from two different observing positions, usually positioned on opposite ends of a known baseline.\n- **Distance (d)**: The result gives the distance to the object in parsecs, where one parsec is approximately 3.26 light-years.\n\nThis formula indicates that as the parallax angle increases, the distance to the object decreases, illustrating an inverse relationship."

  "concept": "Nucleus",
  "explanation": "In the context of photodisintegration, a nucleus refers to the central core of an atom, made up of protons and neutrons. When a nucleus absorbs a high-energy gamma ray, it undergoes a transformation where it becomes excited due to the energy gained from the gamma ray. This absorption sets off a chain reaction that leads to the nucleus emitting subatomic particles such as neutrons, protons, or alpha particles. Thus, the nucleus is crucial in understanding how absorption of energy can result in significant changes to atomic structure."

  "concept": "Atomic Mass Decrease of 4 in Alpha Particle Emission",
  "explanation": "In alpha particle emission, an atomic nucleus ejects an alpha particle, which is composed of 2 protons and 2 neutrons (making up a total mass of 4 units). When this particle is emitted, the total mass of the nucleus decreases by the mass of the alpha particle. For example, in the reaction `\u00b9\u00b2C + \u03b3 \u2192 \u2078Be + \u03b1`, the original nucleus (`\u00b9\u00b2C`) has an atomic mass of 12. After emitting an alpha particle (mass of 4), the resulting nucleus (`\u2078Be`) has an atomic mass of 8. Thus, the atomic mass decreases by 4 as a direct result of the emission of the alpha particle."

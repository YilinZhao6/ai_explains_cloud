{
  "concept": "Excited State",
  "explanation": "In nuclear physics, when we say that a nucleus enters an \"excited state,\" it means that the nucleus has absorbed energy\u2014specifically from a high-energy gamma ray\u2014and transitioned to a higher energy level than its stable, ground state. This excess energy can cause the protons and neutrons within the nucleus to become agitated or rearranged internally. The nucleus remains in this excited state temporarily before it releases that energy, typically by emitting subatomic particles, which was the next step in the process of photodisintegration. Essentially, an excited state reflects a short-lived condition of increased energy readiness before returning to stability."

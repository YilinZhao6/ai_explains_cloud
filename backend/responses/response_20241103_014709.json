  "concept": "p-process",
  "explanation": "The p-process, or proton process, is a type of nucleosynthesis responsible for the creation of heavy, proton-rich isotopes of elements during specific stellar events, such as supernovae. In the context provided, it refers to how photodisintegration contributes to the formation of these isotopes through reactions that occur in the extreme physical conditions of explosive stellar environments. The first metals in the universe were distributed by relativistic jets expelled during the formation of black holes, following these explosive events, where the p-process plays a critical role in producing new elements."

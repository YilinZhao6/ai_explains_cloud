  "concept": "Immediate Decay in Photodisintegration",
  "explanation": "In the context of photodisintegration, when an atomic nucleus absorbs a high-energy gamma ray, it becomes excited and enters a higher energy state. 'It immediately decays' refers to the nucleus quickly transitioning back to a lower energy state by releasing energy in the form of emitted subatomic particles such as neutrons, protons, or alpha particles. This decay happens almost instantaneously and is a defining aspect of the photodisintegration process. The terms 'phototransmutation' and 'photonuclear reaction' emphasize that this is a nuclear reaction driven by the absorption of a photon (gamma ray) that transforms the nucleus's identity by changing the number of protons and neutrons, leading to the formation of different particles."

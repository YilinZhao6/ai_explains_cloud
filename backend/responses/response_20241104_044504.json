  "concept": "Geometric Phenomenon",
  "explanation": "A geometric phenomenon refers to an occurrence or principle that can be explained and analyzed using geometric concepts such as points, lines, angles, and shapes. In the context of parallax, the term emphasizes that the measurements of parallax rely on geometric principles\u2014the arrangement of observation points and the angles formed between them. Specifically, parallax involves creating an isosceles triangle where the baseline is the distance between two observation points and the star being observed forms the apex of the triangle. By using these geometric relationships, astronomers can derive distances to stars, illustrating how the concept of parallax is rooted in geometry."

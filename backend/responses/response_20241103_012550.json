  "concept": "Photon",
  "explanation": "A photon is a quantum of electromagnetic radiation, meaning it is a fundamental particle that carries energy through space in the form of light. In the context of photodisintegration, the term 'photonuclear reaction' emphasizes the role of a high-energy gamma ray (a type of photon) in initiating the nuclear process. When an atomic nucleus absorbs this gamma ray, it becomes excited and then decays by emitting subatomic particles. Thus, the photon directly triggers the transformation of the nucleus, which can lead to the emission of particles like neutrons, protons, or alpha particles."

  "concept": "Photon",
  "explanation": "A photon is a fundamental particle that represents a quantum of light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. In the context of photodisintegration, it refers specifically to the high-energy gamma ray that initiates the nuclear process. When an atomic nucleus absorbs a photon, it enters an excited state before decaying into smaller subatomic particles. The term 'photonuclear reaction' highlights the role of photons (gamma rays) in initiating nuclear reactions such as photodisintegration."

  "concept": "Parallax",
  "explanation": "Parallax refers to the apparent change in the position of an object when viewed from different angles or vantage points. In astropysics, this is crucial for measuring distances to nearby stars. It is demonstrated through the observation of a star from two positions in Earth's orbit, revealing a shift in the star's apparent location against the backdrop of distant stars. The extent of this shift is quantified using the parallax angle, which allows astronomers to calculate the star's distance using a specific formula. By measuring this shift, astronomers can accurately determine how far away the star is from Earth, making parallax essential for mapping the universe."

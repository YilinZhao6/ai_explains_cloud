  "concept": "Phototransmutation",
  "explanation": "Phototransmutation is a term used to describe the process of photodisintegration, where an atomic nucleus absorbs a high-energy gamma ray and subsequently decays by emitting subatomic particles. This term emphasizes the transformation of one element into another due to the interaction with photons (gamma rays). In this context, when the markdown states that 'it immediately decays by emitting subatomic particles,' it refers to how the absorbed gamma ray causes the nucleus to change, resulting in the emission of particles such as protons, neutrons, or alpha particles. This transformation is a key component of nuclear reactions and plays a significant role in astrophysical processes."

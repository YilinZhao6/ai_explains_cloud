  "concept": "Phototransmutation",
  "explanation": "Phototransmutation, also referred to as photodisintegration or photonuclear reaction, is a nuclear process wherein an atomic nucleus absorbs a high-energy gamma ray and subsequently decays by emitting subatomic particles. This decay occurs immediately after the nucleus is excited by the absorbed gamma ray, leading to the release of particles such as protons, neutrons, or alpha particles. In the context of the passage, the emphasis is on the instantaneous nature of this decay, illustrating the direct consequence of the nucleus's interaction with high-energy photons."

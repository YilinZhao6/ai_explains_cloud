  "concept": "Mathematical Formulation",
  "explanation": "A mathematical formulation refers to the representation of a physical concept or phenomenon using mathematical language, symbols, and equations. In the context of the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation, it encapsulates the rules and principles of quantum mechanics into a mathematical expression that effectively describes how the quantum state of a system evolves over time. This formulation provides a systematic way to predict the outcomes of physical processes in quantum mechanics, allowing for quantitative analysis of different quantum states and their probabilities."

  "concept": "Photon",
  "explanation": "A photon is a fundamental particle representing a quantum of light or electromagnetic radiation. In the context of photodisintegration, a photon, specifically a high-energy gamma ray, interacts with an atomic nucleus. This interaction is crucial as it initiates the photodisintegration process by being absorbed by the nucleus, leading to its excitation and subsequent emission of subatomic particles."

  "concept": "Gamma Ray",
  "explanation": "A gamma ray is a type of high-energy electromagnetic radiation. It has a very short wavelength and high frequency, which allows it to carry a significant amount of energy. In the context of photodisintegration, a gamma ray serves as a catalyst that is absorbed by an atomic nucleus, leading to an excited state of the nucleus. This absorption triggers the nucleus to release one or more subatomic particles, resulting in a nuclear reaction. Gamma rays are produced in various astrophysical processes, including shifts in energy levels within atomic nuclei or during nuclear decay."

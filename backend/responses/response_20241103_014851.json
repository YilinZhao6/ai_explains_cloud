  "concept": "Initiates the reaction",
  "explanation": "In the context of photodisintegration, the phrase \"initiates the reaction\" refers to the role of a gamma ray, which is a high-energy photon, in starting the nuclear process. Specifically, when a gamma ray interacts with a target nucleus (the atomic nucleus that absorbs it), it causes the nucleus to enter an excited state. This absorption of energy from the gamma ray is what triggers the subsequent decay of the nucleus, resulting in the emission of subatomic particles such as neutrons, protons, or alpha particles. Thus, the gamma ray serves as the catalyst for the entire photodisintegration process."

  "original_quote": "The moment of inertia $I$ of a body about any axis is equal to the moment of inertia $I_{cm}$ about a parallel axis through its center of mass plus the product of the mass $M$ of the body and the square of the distance $d$ between the two axes.",
  "section_title": "Key Theorems: Parallel and Perpendicular Axis Theorems",
  "reason": "The Parallel Axis Theorem is a key concept in understanding how to calculate moment of inertia for different orientations. An image that visualizes this theorem with an object and axes would help in comprehension.",
  "description": "Illustration showing a rigid body with a marked center of mass, two parallel axes (one through the center of mass and one offset), and annotations explaining the Parallel Axis Theorem.",

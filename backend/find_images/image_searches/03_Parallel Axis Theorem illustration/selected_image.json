  "original_quote": "The moment of inertia $I$ of a body about any axis is equal to the moment of inertia $I_{cm}$ about a parallel axis through its center of mass plus the product of the mass $M$ of the body and the square of the distance $d$ between the two axes.",

  "reason": "The Parallel Axis Theorem is a key concept in understanding how to calculate moment of inertia for different orientations. An image that visualizes this theorem with an object and axes would help in comprehension.",

    "explanation": "The image titled 'image_01.jpg' from study.com provides a clear and concise illustration of the Parallel Axis Theorem. It visually represents a rigid body with its center of mass marked, and two parallel axes are shown: one through the center of mass and another offset. The image includes annotations that explain the theorem, making it an excellent educational tool for understanding the concept without overwhelming text or complex structures.",

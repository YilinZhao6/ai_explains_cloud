  "original_quote": "The moment of inertia, often denoted as $I$, is a fundamental concept in physics that quantifies an object's resistance to changes in its rotational motion.",
  "section_title": "Introduction to Moment of Inertia",
  "reason": "This passage introduces the concept of moment of inertia, which is central to understanding rotational dynamics. An image illustrating this concept could include a visual representation of an object with its axis of rotation and arrows indicating torque and angular acceleration.",
  "description": "An illustration of an object (like a disk or cylinder) with an axis of rotation, showing arrows to represent torque and angular acceleration, highlighting how moment of inertia affects rotational motion.",

  "original_quote": "The moment of inertia, often denoted as $I$, is a fundamental concept in physics that quantifies an object's resistance to changes in its rotational motion.",
  "section_title": "Introduction to Moment of Inertia",
  "reason": "This passage introduces the concept of moment of inertia, which is central to understanding rotational dynamics. An image illustrating this concept could include a visual representation of an object with its axis of rotation and arrows indicating torque and angular acceleration.",
  "description": "An illustration of an object (like a disk or cylinder) with an axis of rotation, showing arrows to represent torque and angular acceleration, highlighting how moment of inertia affects rotational motion.",

    "explanation": "Image 02 provides a clear and simple illustration of the moment of inertia concept. It features a disk with an axis of rotation and arrows indicating torque and angular acceleration, which aligns well with the context provided. The image is free from watermarks and unnecessary text, making it an ideal choice for visualizing the concept of moment of inertia in rotational dynamics.",

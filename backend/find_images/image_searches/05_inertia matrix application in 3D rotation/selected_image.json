    "explanation": "Image 01 provides a clear and relevant depiction of an inertia matrix applied to a 3D object. The image includes a simple structure with an overlay of the inertia matrix on a 3D object, likely a celestial body, and highlights the principal axes. This visual representation aligns well with the context of analyzing rotational behavior using inertia matrices.",

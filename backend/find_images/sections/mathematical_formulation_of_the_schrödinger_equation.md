## Mathematical Formulation of the Schrödinger Equation

### Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation

The **time-dependent Schrödinger Equation** is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the quantum state of a physical system evolves over time. It is expressed as:

\[
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)\]

Where:
- \(\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)\) is the wave function, representing the probability amplitude of finding a particle at position \(\mathbf{r}\) and time \(t\).
- \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck's constant.
- \(\hat{H}\) is the Hamiltonian operator, which includes the kinetic and potential energy of the system.

This equation is pivotal in predicting the behavior of quantum systems over time, allowing for the calculation of probabilities of different outcomes. It is particularly useful in systems where the Hamiltonian is time-dependent, such as in quantum dynamics and spectroscopy.

### Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation

The **time-independent Schrödinger Equation** is derived from the time-dependent version by assuming that the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time. It is used to determine the stationary states and energy levels of quantum systems. The equation is given by:

\[
\hat{H}\psi(\mathbf{r}) = E\psi(\mathbf{r})
\]

Where:
- \(\psi(\mathbf{r})\) is the spatial part of the wave function, independent of time.
- \(E\) is the energy eigenvalue associated with the state \(\psi(\mathbf{r})\).

This equation is crucial for understanding the quantized energy levels in systems such as atoms and molecules. It forms the basis for many applications in quantum chemistry and solid-state physics, where it helps predict the behavior of electrons in potential fields.

### Role of Wave Functions

Wave functions, denoted as \(\Psi\), are solutions to the Schrödinger Equation and are central to quantum mechanics. They provide a probabilistic description of a particle's properties, such as position and momentum. The square of the wave function's magnitude, \(|\Psi|^2\), gives the probability density of finding a particle in a given region of space.

Wave functions embody the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, where the exact outcome of a measurement cannot be predicted with certainty, but rather as a probability distribution. This concept is fundamental to the interpretation of quantum phenomena and underpins the probabilistic framework of quantum theory.

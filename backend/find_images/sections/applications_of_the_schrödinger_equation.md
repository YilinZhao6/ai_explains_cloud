## Applications of the Schrödinger Equation

### Particle in a One-Dimensional Box

The **particle in a one-dimensional box** is a fundamental model in quantum mechanics that illustrates the concept of quantized energy levels. This model considers a particle confined within an infinitely deep potential well, where the potential energy outside the box is infinitely large, effectively trapping the particle inside.

- **Quantization of Energy Levels:**
  - The Schrödinger Equation is applied to determine the allowed energy states of the particle. The boundary conditions require that the wave function, \( \Psi(x) \), must be zero at the walls of the box, leading to solutions that are sinusoidal within the box.
  - The energy levels are given by:
    \[
    E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}
    \]
    where \( n \) is a positive integer (quantum number), \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( m \) is the mass of the particle, and \( L \) is the length of the box.
  - This quantization implies that the particle can only occupy discrete energy levels, a stark contrast to classical mechanics where energy can vary continuously.

- **Implications:**
  - The model demonstrates that the energy of a confined particle cannot be zero, as the lowest energy state (ground state) corresponds to \( n = 1 \).
  - As the size of the confinement decreases, the energy levels become more widely spaced, indicating higher energy requirements for smaller systems.

### Hydrogen Atom

The application of the Schrödinger Equation to the **hydrogen atom** provides a profound insight into atomic structure and electron behavior.

- **Energy Levels and Orbitals:**
  - The equation predicts the quantized energy levels of the hydrogen atom, corresponding to the electron's orbitals. These energy levels are given by:
    \[
    E_n = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{n^2}
    \]
    where \( n \) is the principal quantum number.
  - The negative sign indicates that the electron is bound to the nucleus, with energy levels becoming less negative (higher) as \( n \) increases.

- **Wave Functions and Probability Densities:**
  - The solutions to the Schrödinger Equation for the hydrogen atom are wave functions that describe the probability density of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus.
  - These wave functions, or orbitals, are characterized by quantum numbers that define their shape, orientation, and size.

- **Significance:**
  - The model accurately predicts the spectral lines of hydrogen, confirming the quantized nature of atomic energy levels.
  - It provides a framework for understanding more complex atoms and molecules, forming the basis for quantum chemistry and atomic physics.

By applying the Schrödinger Equation to these systems, we gain a deeper understanding of the quantized nature of energy in quantum mechanics, illustrating how theoretical models can predict and explain real-world phenomena.

Here his the perpendicular distance between the two axes, and Icomis the rotational inertia of the body about the axis through the com. We can describe has being the distance the actual rotation axis has been shifted from the rotation axisthrough the com.Learning Objectives Key Ideas Calculating the Rotational Inertia If a rigid body consists of a few particles, we can calculate its rotational inertiaabout a given rotation axis with Eq. 10-33 ; that is, we can find theproduct mr 2for each particle and then sum the products. (Recall that ris the per- pendicular distance a particle is from the given rotation axis.) If a rigid body consists of a great many adjacent particles (it is continuous, like a Frisbee), using Eq. 10-33 would require a computer. Thus, instead, we replace thesum in Eq. 10-33 with an integral and define the rotational inertia of the body as (rotational inertia, continuous body). (10-35) Table 10-2 gives the results of such integration for nine common body shapes andthe indicated axes of rotation. Parallel-Axis Theorem Suppose we want to find the rotational inertia I of a body of mass M about a given axis. In principle, we can always find Iwith the integration of Eq. 10-35. However, there is a neat shortcut if we happen to already know the rotational in-ertia I comof the body about a parallel axis that extends through the body’s center of mass.

                <p>long rod is much easier to rotate about (a) its central (longitudinal) axis than about (b) an axis through its center and perpendicular to its length. Thereason for the difference is that the massis distributed closer to the rotation axis in(a) than in (b).Rotation axis (a) (b) Rod is easy to rotate this way. Harder this way.Instead, we shall treat the table saw (and any other rotating rigid body) as a collection of particles with different speeds. We can then add up the kinetic energies of all the particles to find the kinetic energy of the body as a whole.In this way we obtain, for the kinetic energy of a rotating body, (10-31) in which m iis the mass of the ith particle and v iis its speed.The sum is taken over all the particles in the body. The problem with Eq. 10-31 is that viis not the same for all particles.We solve this problem by substituting for v from Eq. 10-18 (v /H11005vr), so that we have (10-32) in which v isthe same for all particles. The quantity in parentheses on the right side of Eq. 10-32 tells us how the mass of the rotating body is distributed about its axis of rotation. We callthat quantity the rotational inertia (or moment of inertia) Iof the body with respect to the axis of rotation. It is a constant for a particular rigid body anda particular rotation axis. (Caution: That axis must always be specified if the value of I is to be meaningful.) We may now write (rotational inertia) (10-33) and substitute into Eq. 10-32, obtaining (radian measure) (10-34) as the expression we seek. Because we have used the relation v/H11005vrin deriving Eq. 10-34, vmust be expressed in radian measure. The SI unit for Iis the kilogram–square meter (kg /H11080m2). The Plan. If we have a few particles and a specified rotation axis, we find mr2 for each particle and then add the results as in Eq. 10-33 to get the total rotational in-ertia I. If we want the total rotational kinetic energy, we can then substitute that I into Eq. 10-34. That is the plan for a few particles, but suppose we have a huge num-ber of particles such as in a rod. In the next module we shall see how to handle suchcontinuous bodies and do the calculation in only a few minutes. Equation 10-34, which gives the</p>

                <p>kinetic energy of a rigid body in pure rotation, is the angular equivalent of the formula , which gives the kinetic energy K/H11005 1 2Mvcom2K/H110051 2I/H92752I/H11005/H20858 miri2K/H11005/H20858 1 2mi(vri)2/H110051 2 /H20898/H20858 miri2/H20899v2,/H11005/H20858 1 2 mivi2,K/H110051 2m1v2 1/H110011 2m2v22/H110011 2m3v2 3/H11001 /H11080/H11080/H11080 of a rigid body in pure translation. In both formulas there is a factor of . Where mass Mappears in one equation, I(which involves both mass and its distribution) appears in the other. Finally, each equation contains as a factor the square of aspeed—translational or rotational as appropriate. The kinetic energies of transla-tion and of rotation are not different kinds of energy. They are both kinetic energy,expressed in ways that are appropriate to the motion at hand. We noted previously that the rotational inertia of a rotating body involves not only its mass but also how that mass is distributed. Here is an example thatyou can literally feel. Rotate a long, fairly heavy rod (a pole, a length of lumber,or something similar), first around its central (longitudinal) axis (Fig. 10-11a ) and then around an axis perpendicular to the rod and through the center(Fig. 10-11b ). Both rotations involve the very same mass, but the first rotation is much easier than the second. The reason is that the mass is distributed muchcloser to the rotation axis in the first rotation. As a result, the rotational inertiaof the rod is much smaller in Fig. 10-11a than in Fig. 10-11b . In general, smaller rotational inertia means easier rotation.1 2halliday_c10_221-254v3.0.1.qxd 3/5/14 9:57 AM Page 236 237 10-5 CALCULATING THE ROTATIONAL INERTIA Checkpoint 4 The figure shows three small spheres that rotate about a vertical axis.The perpendicular distance between the axis and the center of each sphere isgiven.

                <p>where Ris the dis- tance from O to dm, the first integral is simply I com, the rotational inertia of the body about an axis through its center of mass. Inspection of Fig. 10-12 shows that the last term in Eq. 10-37 is Mh2, where Mis the body’s total mass. Thus, Eq. 10-37 reduces to Eq. 10-36, which is the relation that we set out to prove.

KEY IDEAS This situation is simple enough that we can find Iusing either of two techniques. The first is similar to the one used in part (a). The other, more powerful one is to apply the parallel-axis theorem.

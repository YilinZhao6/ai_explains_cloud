Created with mandelbulber2. Rendering duration: 13m 8.3s. Every line in the image is smaller than the lower one. The edge on the top of the image is the limit. Underneath it, there are infinitely many rows. The highest line in this fractal is infinitesimally large in comparison of the line 1 with 1 lenght unit height. This phenomenom is analog to the following: If you travel per step only the half of the length you travelled in the step before (in the first step you travel one meter), you will never finish 2 meters, but you get with every step closer. If you add here the heights of every line (beginning with line 1), you will never get the actual height of all lines, but you get with adding more and more lines closer. This image shows: <ul><li>Self-similarity</li> <li>Triangles</li> <li>An infinite number of identical lines (despite of position and size)</li> <li>Asymptotic approximation via the height of the lines to the height of this image crop of the fractal.</li> <li>Symmetric perspective of a symmetric shape</li></ul>",
